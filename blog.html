				 Types of nuts and seeds</p>
				<p class="text"> Research shows that making nuts a regular part of a healthy diet helps to regulate our weight, and can protect against chronic diseases (such as heart disease and diabetes).
				
				Although there has been limited research on seeds, they are thought to have similar health benefits to nuts due to their nutrient content which is comparable to nuts. </p>

WHO WE ARE
What Is A Healthy Entertainment?

Difficult question? Of course not as it depends on your age, background, locality and interests! But one thing is sure, entertainment is different from the routine work! Even going out for dinner or walking alone at unknown place is entertainment! Right, yet question is bit different! See at the heading again! Physical exercise and healthy food? No, but a movie, book, painting, dance can be entertaining, if it makes you forget the tension! But if this attaches you to the social evils and better, the struggle to fight against this evil, it attaches you to the society, reduces your selfishness!

Poem, stories, arts are created today to earn money, so are the films, TV serials. We really lack, what we are looking for, in fact in today's "market", we even fail to understand, what is best suited for us!

I am not giving you the answer, but trying to shake your brain!</p>

				<p class="text"> It’s hard to maintain the lifestyle changes you want to make. It doesn’t matter whether your goal is weight loss, exercise, normal blood sugar, or decreasing stress — research has shown that simply learning about the value of lifestyle changes is insufficient on its own to help people maintain their goals.
				
				Of course, few people are actually ignorant about the number of calories in a chocolate truffle, the benefits of exercise, or the incredible danger, discomfort, and inconvenience of diabetes and stress. Still, despite this awareness, maintaining these changes is an uphill battle. And that’s largely because habits are hard to kick.
				
				The rewards of the changes themselves have their limits. On a cold, snowy day in February, going to the gym is far less appealing than staying in bed for one more hour. And when you return home tired from a day of work, the calories in that extra glass of wine may in fact suddenly turn invisible. So how can you get that extra motivation? </p>

So the next time you’re feeling guilty for skipping the gym in favor of a reading a good book, keep these 8 health benefits in mind: </p>
